# McHacks 2021 MoodTracker project
* Web application that uses a variety of data such as sleep quality, exercise time, and stress levels to predict the mood of an individual. <br>
* Uses Python to perform PCA, relying on libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, MatPlotLib, and scikit-learn for data processing. <br>
* The backend is built in PHP, using SQL queries to access a MySQL database, while the frontend uses plain HTML/CSS/JS.
* Built in a team of 3 within the span of 2 days as a submission for the Huawei Wellness Challenge.
